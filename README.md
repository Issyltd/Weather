# **React Project 4 - Weather**
Completed: 26/09/22

## What is This Project?
It is a very basic weather application made by intergrating an API
&nbsp;

## Issues I Encountered
Biggest issue with it (Main reason I'll be coming back to it) is that the °C and °F function very strangely and I'm not able to figure out why just yet.

Spent quite a bit of time trying to solve it but I'm not advanced enough to properly get it.
